    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Hank Sent Me</strong> is a Chrome Extension that helps users score the strength of mutual LinkedIn
        connections based on publicly visible profile information.
    </p>
    <p>
        This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, credentials, or private LinkedIn
        data. All processing occurs locally within the user browser. No data is sent to any external server or third
        party.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hank only analyzes DOM elements visible to any logged-in LinkedIn user and discards all data when the popup is
        closed.
